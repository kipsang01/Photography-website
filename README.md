Taking of quality photos requires high quality cameras and taking it skillfully. This has seen photography being a profession by many.
  
     	DESCRIPTION
Photography website project is a site that shows a quality pictures taken by various people. It puts them together to appreciate their efforts and for photography lovers who could find interest on them.
It classifies photos according to similarities and of different classes. We have those pictures taken on natural environment this include pictures of forests, rivers, mountains and any other thing thats natural and looks nice.
Also we have those of cars. So many people love cars and thus photographers find interesting to take good pictures of nice cars. This is also used in advertisements by car selling companies and showing clients how their cars can be the best as most of people like more appealing looks than functionality as suggested by psychology.
Animals have been a human companion for long time and people have took some to be pets. Taking pictures is inevitable and this is another broad classification of pictures and we put it all as animals and we gave a sample of them.
Sports also is a human activity that started way back long time and use of cameras to record every event is necessary  thus bring us to a different class of photos. i’ve put together so you can see them.
As all photos cannot fit on same page have added a link to every class of photos so you can see them all.
